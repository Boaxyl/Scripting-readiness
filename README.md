# AWS Resource Deployment Requirements

## 🧾 Overview

This project involves automating the deployment of AWS resources using the AWS CLI. The key components include:

- Creating an **EC2 instance**
- Configuring an **S3 bucket**
- Verifying **deployment statuses** using AWS CLI

## 🔐 Prerequisites

Before running the deployment scripts, ensure the following:

- AWS CLI is installed and configured with valid AWS credentials.
- Necessary IAM permissions are granted to perform EC2 and S3 operations.

## 🧩 Code Structure Guidelines

- Each AWS resource deployment should be **packaged as a function** for better readability and modularity.
- Functions should be invoked within the main script to execute the deployment flow.

## 🛠 Bash Script Requirements

- The script should be written primarily using **functions** to encapsulate logic.
- It must include **error handling** to gracefully manage failures and provide meaningful feedback.
- Logging or status messages should be included to track progress and outcomes.

## ✅ Goals

- Automate infrastructure setup using AWS CLI.
- Maintain clean, readable, and reusable code.
- Ensure robust error handling for production-grade reliability.
